# Fast Track Incentive Simulator
## Focus Group Instructions

---

## 1. Baseline Assumptions (Already Decided)

These settings reflect decisions already made for the Fast Track program:

| Setting | Value | What It Means |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| **Rental AMI Threshold** | 80% | Affordable rental units serve households earning up to $65,280/year (2-person household) |
| **Ownership AMI Threshold** | 100% | Affordable for-sale homes serve households earning up to $81,600/year |
| **Minimum Affordable Units** | 25% | To qualify for Fast Track, at least 25% of base units must be affordable |
| **Default Affordability Period** | 15 years | Units must remain affordable for at least 15 years (adjustable for comparison) |

---

## 2. What We Need Your Input On

The Focus Group will help determine the **right balance** for these policy levers:

### Density Bonus
- **How much extra density should we allow?** (Currently 20%, range 0-50%)
- **What % of bonus units should be affordable?** (Currently 50%)

### Fee Waivers & Reductions
- **Tap & System Fee Reduction** — How much? (Currently 60%)
- **Use Tax Rebate** — What percentage? (Currently 50%)
- **Planning/Building Permits** — Waive entirely? (Currently yes)

### Affordability Period Trade-offs
- **15 years** = Lower developer cost, but less long-term affordability
- **30 years** = More community benefit, but higher developer cost
- **What's the right balance?**

## 3. How to Use the Simulator

### The Sidebar (Left Side)
This is where you adjust policy settings:

1. **Affordability Period** — Slide to compare 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, or 99 years
2. **Project Type** — Toggle between Rental and Ownership projects
3. **Density Bonus** — Adjust how much extra density to allow
4. **Fee Waivers** — Turn on/off different fee waivers and adjust percentages

### The Results (Main Area)
Four key metrics appear at the top:
- **Total Units Created** — How many homes this scenario produces
- **Affordable Units** — How many are income-restricted
- **Developer Net Gain** — Does Fast Track "add value" for builders?
- **City Cost per Unit-Year** — How efficient is the city's investment?

---

## 4. What to Watch When Changing Inputs

### Developer Net Gain (Green = Good, Red = Bad)
- **Green "Fast Track Adds Value"** = Incentives outweigh affordability costs
- **Red "Cost Exceeds Benefits"** = Developer loses money participating

**Key insight:** If this goes red, developers won't use Fast Track!

### City Cost per Unit-Year
- **Lower is better** — More affordable housing per dollar invested
- **Longer affordability periods** reduce this number (same investment, more years)

### The Trade-off
- **More developer benefits** (higher density bonus, more fee waivers) → More attractive to builders
- **Longer affordability periods** → Better for community, but increases developer costs

**Your goal:** Find combinations where BOTH sides benefit!

## 5. Try This: Finding Your Sweet Spot

### Step 1: Note the Starting Point
With default settings (15yr, 20% density bonus), write down:
- Developer Net Gain: $________
- City Cost/Unit-Year: $________
- Affordable Units: ________

### Step 2: Increase Density Bonus
Move the slider from 20% to 30%
- What happened to Developer Net Gain?
- Did affordable units increase?

### Step 3: Try a Longer Affordability Period
Change from 15 years to 30 years
- City Cost/Unit-Year should drop (good!)
- Did Developer Net Gain go negative? (problem!)

### Step 4: Compensate with Fee Waivers
If developer went negative, try:
- Increasing Tap Fee Reduction to 80% or 100%
- Can you get back to green while keeping 30 years?

### Step 5: Compare Rental vs Ownership
Switch "Project Type" to Ownership
- How do the economics differ?
- Which project type works better with longer affordability?

### Step 6: Export Your Scenario
Once you find a balanced approach:
1. Go to the **Export** tab
2. Click **Download Results (CSV)**
3. Share your scenario with the group!

## Key Questions to Consider

As you explore, think about:

1. **What's the minimum density bonus** that makes Fast Track attractive?
2. **Can we achieve 30-year affordability** without losing developer interest?
3. **Which fee waivers matter most** to making projects feasible?
4. **Should rental and ownership projects** have different requirements?
