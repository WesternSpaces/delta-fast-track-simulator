### What Does NOT Change:
- **Standards:** All Delta codes, zoning, and design requirements still apply
- **Authority:** Delta staff, Planning Commission, and City Council still make final decisions
- **Approval:** Can approve, approve with conditions, or deny
- **Community Input:** Pre-application consultation and public hearings still required for discretionary reviews

**Delta Maintains Control:** Fast Track is a local program designed by Delta for Delta. Prop 123 requires expedited review, but Delta decides: eligibility criteria, application requirements, review standards, extension policies, and final approval.
